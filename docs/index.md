### [Chelan Douglas Health District](./2024/Chelan-Douglas_Health_District)

Reports summarizing monitoring data available each smoke season in Chelan,
Douglas and Okanogan counties in north central Washington state. A summary
page has tables of the number of days each monitoring site spent in each
Air Quality Category.

### [State Air Quality Category Tables](./2024/State_AQC_Tables)

Tables and plots summarizing the cumulative number of days PM2.5 monitors
spent in each Air Quality Category during a given month. These tables and plots
are calculated using existing (2023) and updated (2024) NAAQS and allow for an
easy review of the impact of the updated NAAWQS. Each report covers one state 
for a given month with tables and plots for the years 2014 to 2023.
