The US EPA recently announced updated NAAQS (National Ambient Air Quality
Standards) for PM2.5. The lowered thresholds will result in a change in the 
number of days in a particular Air Quality Category (AQC).

The number of days a community spends in each category is a useful health
statistic.

The US EPA defines the following Air Quality Categories:

* Good -- Air quality is satisfactory, and air pollution poses little or no risk.
* Moderate -- Air quality is acceptable. However, there may be a risk for some people, particularly those who are unusually sensitive to air pollution.
* USG (Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups) -- Members of sensitive groups may experience health effects. The general public is less likely to be affected.
* Unhealthy -- Some members of the general public may experience health effects; members of sensitive groups may experience more serious health effects.
* Very Unhealthy -- Health alert: The risk of health effects is increased for everyone.
* Hazardous -- Health warning of emergency conditions: everyone is more likely to be affected.

## Daily AQC Reports by State and Month

The following table provides linnks to reports summarizing the cumulative number 
of days PM2.5 monitors spent in each Air Quality Category during a given month. 
These tables and plots are calculated using existing (2023) and updated (2024) 
NAAQS and allow for an easy review of the impact of the updated NAAWQS. Each 
report covers one state for a given month with tables and plots for the years 
2014 to 2023.
