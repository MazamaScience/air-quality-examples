The Chelan-Douglas Health District (CDHP) in north central Washington state is
doing a review of the impacts of smoke during fire seasons over the past decade.
The area of interest covers Chelan, Douglas and Okanogan counties.

## Monitoring Data Daily AQC Counts

The US EPA defines the following Air Quality Categories (AQC):

* Good -- Air quality is satisfactory, and air pollution poses little or no risk.
* Moderate -- Air quality is acceptable. However, there may be a risk for some people, particularly those who are unusually sensitive to air pollution.
* USG (Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups) -- Members of sensitive groups may experience health effects. The general public is less likely to be affected.
* Unhealthy -- Some members of the general public may experience health effects; members of sensitive groups may experience more serious health effects.
* Very Unhealthy -- Health alert: The risk of health effects is increased for everyone.
* Hazardous -- Health warning of emergency conditions: everyone is more likely to be affected.

The number of days a community spends in each category is a useful health
statistic.

The [Daily AQC Counts](./daily_AQC_counts.html) page displays tables with
the number of days each site spent in each Air Quality Category in a given
year. Links are provided to data reports showing hourly values and daily 
averages for each site.

_Note that this report includes data from temporary monitors that have incomplete
data._
