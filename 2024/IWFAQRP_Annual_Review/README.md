## Background

The Interagency Wildland Fire Air Quality Response Program 
([IWFAQRP](https://www.wildlandfiresmoke.net)) was created to directly assess, 
communicate, and address risks posed by wildland fire smoke to the public as 
well as fire personnel. The program depends on four primary components: 
specially trained personnel called Air Resource Advisors, air quality monitoring, 
smoke concentration and dispersion modeling, and coordination and cooperation 
with agency partners.

The R scripts in this directory data from the 2023 Wildfire season and create
summary graphics for use in annual reporting..
The [AirMonitor](https://github.com/MazamaScience/AirMonitor) 
package is used to access data from the USFS AirFire database of monitoring data.

These scripts involve contributions from: Lee Tarnay, Amy Marsha, Paul Corrigan
and Jonathan Callahan.
